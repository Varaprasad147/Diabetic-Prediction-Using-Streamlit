🩺 Diabetic Prediction Using Streamlit
This project is a machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical parameters. It provides a simple and interactive interface for users to input their data and get instant predictions.

🚀 Features
✅ User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

✅ Uses a trained machine learning model (SVM)

✅ Real-time prediction based on user input

✅ Clean and responsive UI

✅ Deployment-ready

📁 Dataset
This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Input Features:

Pregnancies

Glucose

BloodPressure

SkinThickness

Insulin

BMI

DiabetesPedigreeFunction

Age

Target Variable:

1 → Diabetic

0 → Non-Diabetic

🧠 Machine Learning Model
Although the project uses SVM (Support Vector Machine) as the primary model, it is flexible enough to support alternatives like:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The model is trained using scikit-learn and saved using joblib or pickle.
